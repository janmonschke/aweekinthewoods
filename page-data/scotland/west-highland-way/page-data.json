Before, I only went on day hikes or camping by bike or car but I never hiked with a big backpack carrying a tent, food and water. And, as it turned out quickly, I did not prepare well enough and made pretty much all the rocky mistakes there are. This long-distance hike report is from the summer of 2014.</p>\n<h2>Map</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1gXGDClJ1598Wz-I2wyujKGGvC28\"></iframe>\n(I marked all our campsites on the map with blue markers)\n<h2>Sections</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#section1\">Milngavie to Milarrochry Bay Camping</a> (37km)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#section2\">Milarrochry Bay Camping to Inversnaid Bunkhouse</a> (17km)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#section3\">Inversnaid Bunkhouse to Tyndrum</a> (30km)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#section4\">Tyndrum to Kingshouse</a> (29km)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#section5\">Kingshouse to Kinlochleven MacDonald Campsite</a> (15km)</li>\n<li><a href=\"#section6\">Kinlochleven MacDonald Campsite to Fort William</a> (23km)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The original plan was to finish the hike in 7 days, but on the first day we decided that it would be a great idea to actually do it in only 6 days ;). We made that decision before it started to rain that afternoon and not knowing that we would have to hike a lot longer than planned that day, because it was forbidden to camp at the beginning of the hike back then. Since there are plenty of villages along the trail we could have stopped before, but we were already committed.</p>\n<h3><a name='section1'></a>Day 1: Milngavie to Milarrochry Bay (37km)</h3>\n<p>The start of the West Highland Way is located just north of Glasgow in <strong>Milngavie</strong> which is easily accessible by train or by car. You will definitely bump into other WHW hikers there. Everyone is eager to stock up on supplies and taking pictures at the starting point. The trail starts off smoothly through a lightly vegetated forest, then leads you over farmland, passing by a <strong>whiskey distillery</strong>. You are always facing the peaks of the highlands ahead of you. We were lucky with the weather in the beginning with only very light rain and almost no wind but plenty of sun peeking through the clouds every now and then.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/41e42/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 51.48148148148148%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"First views of Loch Lomond right after Drymen\"\n        title=\"First views of Loch Lomond right after Drymen\"\n        src=\"/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/2e17a/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/256c8/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg 300w,\n/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/d5c47/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg 600w,\n/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/2e17a/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg 1200w,\n/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/e428f/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg 1800w,\n/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/29666/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg 2400w,\n/static/80af926b6193277c53cb2acc6c6b7af1/41e42/01-drymen-to-conic-hill.jpg 4320w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<span class=\"image-caption\">First views of Loch Lomond right after Drymen</span></p>\n<p>It did not take us long before we arrived in <strong>Drymen</strong> where we wanted to camp in one of the dedicated “wild campsites” (farmers offering their backyard and facilities to hikers for some pounds). Since it was still early afternoon and the weather was nice, we decided to continue further until <strong>Balmaha</strong>. After Drymen, the path leads you through a forest before arriving at the foot of Conic Hill. Right when we could see <strong>Conic Hill</strong> through the forest we also saw heavy rain clouds coming towards us and the rain started right when we were starting the ascent. At that point we were halfway to Balmaha and decided it would not make sense to go back to Drymen and stop there, rather than pushing over the the hill.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/13223/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.571030640668525%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Rain started pouring on top of Conic Hill but the view onto Lake Lomond made up for it\"\n        title=\"Rain started pouring on top of Conic Hill but the view onto Lake Lomond made up for it\"\n        src=\"/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/2e17a/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/256c8/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg 300w,\n/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/d5c47/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg 600w,\n/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/2e17a/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg 1200w,\n/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/e428f/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg 1800w,\n/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/29666/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg 2400w,\n/static/95b27b2036bfe1f34b4584920c1ea3a1/13223/01-loch-lomond-from-conic-hill.jpg 4308w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<span class=\"image-caption\">Rain started pouring on top of Conic Hill but the view onto Lake Lomond made up for it</span></p>\n<p>The peak of Conic Hill presented a great view onto <strong>Loch Lomond</strong>. Sadly the rain picked up even more on our way down to Balmaha which left us arriving completely soaked in the evening. It then turned out that there was no campsite in Balmaha and all hotels were booked out. A quick look in our guide book showed a campsite a couple of miles outside of Balmaha. So we started the last stretch of that day right when it started to get dark and when the rain was still pouring heavily onto our already soaked backpacks.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the campsite it was pretty hard to find a spot that was not completely flooded. Luckily, a wet ground was no problem for our tent. I bought it with the possibility in mind to pitch it on very wet Scottish soil. The campsite had excellent facilities so we were able to cook in a dry spot with a roof over our heads. We were completely exhausted and the simple pasta dinner tasted like the best thing we ever ate!</p>\n<h3><a name='section2'></a>Day 2: Milarrochry Bay to Inversnaid (17km)</h3>\n<p>The next morning we had a giant breakfast which contained of ALL the cereals and milk we had brought. We did not anticipate at all the appetite that you get when hiking for almost 40km. It was also this morning that we started to mingle with other hikers for the first time. There was a group of 4 hikers (2 German, 2 English) that we bonded with immediately and we decided to start to hike together that day.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/25fda/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 55.83662102576004%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"We started the morning hiking along Loch Lomond\"\n        title=\"We started the morning hiking along Loch Lomond\"\n        src=\"/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/2e17a/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/256c8/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg 300w,\n/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/d5c47/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg 600w,\n/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/2e17a/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg 1200w,\n/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/e428f/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg 1800w,\n/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/29666/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg 2400w,\n/static/611da9be011d8d17b5a16a48f87fddc7/25fda/02-we-reached-loch-lomond.jpg 4309w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<span class=\"image-caption\">We started the morning hiking along Loch Lomond</span></p>\n<p>It was beautiful to hike in the woods and shores right next to Loch Lomond and the sun also came out for most of the day.

Looking at all the clothes that were drying we realised that we packed way too many clothes for the hike. I brought 4 T-Shirts, socks for each day, jeans and two jumpers. I had no prior long-distance hiking experience, so I thought it would be like on a regular vacation where you change clothes very often. In the end I only used 2 T-Shirts (fast-drying ones) and three pairs of socks. The jeans I should’ve just left home since they never really dried and there was no opportunity to wear them.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/41e42/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.10648148148148%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Relaxing with a beautiful view and great weather\"\n        title=\"Relaxing with a beautiful view and great weather\"\n        src=\"/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/2e17a/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/256c8/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg 300w,\n/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/d5c47/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg 600w,\n/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/2e17a/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg 1200w,\n/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/e428f/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg 1800w,\n/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/29666/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg 2400w,\n/static/e2f6ca61eb206aa7ae2ec173ae994895/41e42/02-enjoying-the-view.jpg 4320w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<span class=\"image-caption\">Relaxing with a beautiful view and great weather</span></p>\n<p>After a couple kilometers we met another group of hikers who were hiking at a similar rhythm to us and we continued together along the shores of Loch Lomond.

It was perfect to hike with him because he taught us so much about the flowers and animals along the path.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1200px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/13223/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 58.86722376973073%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Looking back through the valley\"\n        title=\"Looking back through the valley\"\n        src=\"/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/2e17a/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/256c8/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg 300w,\n/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/d5c47/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg 600w,\n/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/2e17a/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg 1200w,\n/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/e428f/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg 1800w,\n/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/29666/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg 2400w,\n/static/4a4610533973d1e474c2cae4e11b4f52/13223/03-mountain-views-before-tyndrum.jpg 4308w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<span class=\"image-caption\">Looking back through the valley</span></p>\n<p>We decided to hike together until <strong>Tyndrum</strong> and he told us that he always stops there to get his favourite dish: <strong>Cullen Sink</strong>, a rich potato soup with smoked Haddock.

The campsite is right next to a creek and there are many <strong>deer</strong> about at all times. A magical place to arrive to after a long hike. While the main hotel is not open for hikers without reservations, Kingshouse has a special <strong>pub-like backroom</strong> dedicated to hikers. There they serve <strong>gigantic dinners</strong> and a variety of <strong>whiskeys</strong>. We spent the evening eating, drinking and talking with our friend Colin and his daughter (who joined him there to finish the rest of hike together with him). It always surprises me how easy it is to get caught in deep conversations with people that you just met that day. Must be something about the hiker’s nature…</p>\n<h3><a name='section5'></a>Day 5: Kingshouse to Kinlochleven (15km)</h3>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

We really wanted to be up early for this section. It’s not a long section but definitely a tough one. The first major hurdle on this section is the <strong>devil’s staircase</strong>. After descending to Kingshouse’s valley the day before we now had to go back up the mountain on this steep zig-zag path that just did not want to end. To be fair, the days before we had walked faster than we had anticipated and our untrained bodies were not ready for hiking such long days. So this steep incline took us quite a while to finish.</p>\n<p>Right before reaching the top we had a quick snack break and turned around to take in the great views onto <strong>Glencoe</strong>. The entire day we hiked with great views until we started the descent onto <strong>Kinlochleven</strong> which should mark our stop for that day.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;

We cooked up pretty much everything we had left over in our bags. The day before we found a great spot at the campsite right next to a lake and we were wondering why no one pitched their tent there. Well, we found out pretty quickly why. That morning we got attacked by clouds of <strong>Highland midges</strong>. Many people had warned us about these special kinds of mosquitos that only exist in the Scottish Highlands but we were lucky to not have encountered them before. They do bite, but their bites don’t sting much and go away quite quickly. The worst thing about them is the fact that they are super tiny and come in clouds that eat surround you within seconds. Luckily we could cook in a little shed, safe from the beasts.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;

It didn’t matter to us. We felt accomplished and we rested up in the sun in Fort William that afternoon. Our train left later that day and it took just 3.5h to get back to Glasgow. 3.5h by train for what took us 6 days by foot ;)</p>\n<h2>Learnings</h2>\n<p>This being my first long-distance hike, I naturally made many mistakes. The first one being that <strong>I packed way too many things</strong>. I probably did not think about it too much before, because why else would I have started the hike in jeans and brought so many extra pairs of clothes. It is totally fine to not wear fresh clothes every day. It will only take you a day or two to get used to it but it is totally normal.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned was to get yourself familiar with your gear before you start the hike. In our case we had troubles setting up the tent at night with heavy rain pouring down on us because we had never really set it up before. Try to set up your tent at least once before you start and you should be good ;)</p>\n<p>Same goes for your backpack. You should <strong>find a comfortable setting before you start</strong>, otherwise you will spend days fiddling around with it which can be very tiring. Best seek for help in an outdoor shop, the staff there usually is pretty helpful.</p>\n<p>Boots! Yes, boots! <strong>Bring boots that are worn in and that you feel comfortable in</strong>. This was probably my biggest problem on the hike. I had bought boots just before the hike, the same ones that I usually bought, but I did not wear them in before. So I had very bad blisters from day one on. Whenever I buy a pair of boots now I make sure to wear them for a couple of days during the week or I use them on day hikes. You really don’t want to increase the risk for blisters on such a long hike. It is probably not possible to 100% prevent them, but at least you’re minimizing the risk by bringing good shoes.</p>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p>As for all famous Scottish hikes, the best source of information for the West Highland Way is <strong><a href=\"https://walkhighlands.co.uk\">walkhighlands.co.uk</a></strong>. There you will find detailed section descriptions with images and exhaustive lists of accommodations along the trail. As it turns out, this hike is probably one of the best equipped hikes in Scotland and for every sections there are plenty of options to refill your water, to re-stock food and to stay at over night (hotels and campsites). Each hike on that website has a little forum where people share their experiences and tips and tricks which I found really helpful (even though I should have read them more carefully ;) ).</p>\n<p>In addition to the website I bought a book with maps which seemed to be the go-to book for the trail. I saw so many other hikers with the same book while hiking and I can recommend it a lot. It’s <strong>“West Highland Way” by Charlie Loram</strong>. The maps are hand-drawn which at first seemed silly to me but they turned out to be very exact and the times and distances always prove to be correct. On top of that it has great descriptions of the landmarks, the towns, the trails’s history and all accommodations.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"West Highland Way","date":"September 19, 2017","cover":{"id":"e62bf829-3c62-527d-b1e3-bde47df44b67","childImageSharp":{"id":"4b14fd12-cc67-59e7-bfd4-6d02cddd7801","fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":400,"height":195,"src":"/static/7356693641e5da341fc83a5d26c523c4/2244e/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7356693641e5da341fc83a5d26c523c4/2244e/cover.jpg 1x,\n/static/7356693641e5da341fc83a5d26c523c4/4fe8c/cover.jpg 1.5x,\n/static/7356693641e5da341fc83a5d26c523c4/14b42/cover.jpg 2x"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/scotland/west-highland-way/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/france/auvergne/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Mountain hiking in the Auvergne (GR400)"}}}}}
