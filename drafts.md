## Research

Since I knew that we did not want to follow the Arran Coastal Way all the time because some of the sections were mainly road-walking, I had to do some further research to find hikes on the island. If you're not interested in the research. I used all these sources for planning the hike around Arran:

[walkhighlands.co.uk]: Still the best resource for all long-distance hikes in Scotland. You can find detailed text descriptions, images and GPX files for all sections of the hike along with recommendations on where to stock up on groceries and where to find accommodation. In addition to that they also have a great community forum with plenty of people eager to help you plan your hike.

[Walking on Arran] by Paddy Dillon: After reading about the road walking sections on the hike I bought this book that helped in finding alternative sections all over the island. Paddy provides in-depth descriptions of hikes with detailed custom maps that make it easy to navigate. Still, it would have been great to get the GPX files for the hikes from the website.

[komoot]: A great tool to plan hike paths in detail and to get inspired by hikes that other users submitted. I used it to plan every section on this hike and to re-route on the go when we decided for taking a detour or a shorter path. With the newest version it also lets you plan paths that don't follow official hiking paths which comes in handy when you want to go for an off-road expedition on the numerous hills.

[Organic Maps]: I exported the hikes to KML and used Organic Maps for the navigation as it provides free offline maps for pretty much everywhere in the world.

[Google Maps]: Since we did not have campsites to our availability at all sections, I used Google Maps to find possible wild camping spots and it worked out great!
