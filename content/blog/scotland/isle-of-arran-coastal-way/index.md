I had been eyeing another hike in Scotland for a long time and when I cam across the [Isle of Arran Coastal Way][] I was immediately hooked. Arran is described as Scotland in miniature because it has everything that Scotland has to offer but condensed into a small-ish island (mountains, green pastures, wildlife, shores). The seven stages of this long-distance hike circle the entire island along its shores.

Since some of the stages require a lot of road-walking, I decided to re-route us through the mountains for two of the stages. That way we avoided the roads and had a couple relaxed slack-packing hikes. The island features a regular bus service which came in very handy on our alternative stages and when we wanted to restock our supplies.

### <a name='section1'></a>Day 1: Brodick to Sannox Bay (17km)

We started our journey early in the morning in **Glasgow** by hopping on a train to the **Ardrossan Ferry Terminal**. From there we took the ferry to **Brodick**. The entire trip took only 2h and was a scenic one already. Not soon after the ferry leaves the terminal, you can make out the peak of **Goatfell** on Arran. It felt great to stand on the ferry deck with a stiff breeze in our faces, slowly getting closer to the island.

After the arrival in Brodick we started right away on the path along the coast. It's easy to spot as there are plenty of markers and signs. The first section of the hike gives you two options: A relaxed path along the coast that has several parts that require road-walking, or a path that leads you up Goatfell and then back to the coast with minial road-walking. We opted for the more strenous route up Goatfell.

The weather was quite...well...Scottish. It was overcast, windy, with slight rain drizzle and the sun peaking out through the clouds from time to time. It was exactly what we signed up for and we enjoyed it. The first kilometers of the hike guide you along the coast over sandy paths, then a golf course and then into the forest that marks the start of the ascent to Goatfell.

The higher we got up to Goatfell, the weather started to get more and more rugged. Dark clouds were forming around the peak and the wind got very intense. When we reached the saddle of Goatfell we left our backpacks in a secluded spot and started our ascent. That was when the wind picked up even more and we could barely see 2m far. After 15min we decided it would be too dangerous to try to all the way up. The wind was so strong you could lean your full weight into it and you would still tip you over.

As soon as we hiked down from the saddle, the weather cleared up and the sun came out. Instead of regretting to not have gone further up, we enjoyed the lush landscape and the smooth descent back to the coast. When we reached the shore we were greeted by rainbows and and easy walk on the road to a picknick site after Sannox Bay with plenty of space for all our tents.
