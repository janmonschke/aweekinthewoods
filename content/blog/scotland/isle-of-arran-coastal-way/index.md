I had been eyeing another hike in Scotland for a long time and when I cam across the [Isle of Arran Coastal Way], I was immediately hooked. Arran is described as Scotland in miniature because it has everything that Scotland has to offer but condensed into a small-ish island (mountains, green pastures, shores, deer, puffins, seals, midges...). The seven stages of this long-distance hike circle the entire island along its shores.

<!-- more -->

Since some of the stages require a lot of road-walking, I decided to re-route us through the mountains for two of the stages. That way we avoided the roads and had a couple relaxed slack-packing hikes. The island features a regular bus service which came in very handy on our alternative stages and when we wanted to restock our supplies.

### <a name='section1'></a>Day 1: Brodick to Sannox Bay (17km)

We started our journey early in the morning in **Glasgow** by hopping on a train to the **Ardrossan Ferry Terminal**. From there we took the ferry to **Brodick**. The entire trip took only 2h and was a scenic one already. Not soon after the ferry leaves the terminal, you can make out the peak of **Goatfell** on Arran. It felt great to stand on the ferry deck with a stiff breeze in our faces, slowly getting closer to the island.

After the arrival in Brodick we started right away on the path along the coast. It's easy to spot as there are plenty of markers and signs. The first section of the hike gives you two options: A relaxed path along the coast that has several parts that require road-walking, or a path that leads you up Goatfell and then back to the coast with minial road-walking. We opted for the more strenous route up Goatfell.

The weather was quite...well...Scottish. It was overcast, windy, with slight rain drizzle and the sun peaking out through the clouds from time to time. It was exactly what we signed up for and we enjoyed it. The first kilometers of the hike guide you along the coast over sandy paths, then a golf course and then into the forest that marks the start of the ascent to Goatfell.

The higher we got up to Goatfell, the weather started to get more and more rugged. Dark clouds were forming around the peak and the wind got very intense. When we reached the saddle of Goatfell we left our backpacks in a secluded spot and started our ascent. That was when the wind picked up even more and we could barely see 2m far. After 15min we decided it would be too dangerous to try to all the way up. The wind was so strong you could lean your full weight into it and you would still tip you over.

As soon as we hiked down from the saddle, the weather cleared up and the sun came out. Instead of regretting to not have gone further up, we enjoyed the lush landscape and the smooth descent back to the coast.

When we reached the shore we were greeted by rainbows and and easy walk on the road to a picknick site after **Sannox Bay** with plenty of space for all our tents.

### <a name="section2"></a>Day 2: Sannox Bay to Lochranza (14km)

On day two we continued along the flat coastal path for most of the day. The weather cleared up a bit, it was not raining anymore but still pretty overcast. Joined by two more friends that arrived on the island that morning and came to Sannox by bus, we headed onto this more relaxed section of the hike.

![Plenty of walking along the coast on day two](./images/02-walking-along-the-coast.jpg)

<span class="image-caption">So green, and so close to the sea ‚ô•Ô∏è</span>

It felt magical walking right next to the coastal line. The sound of the waves, the salty smell, walking on sand and stone beaches. In contrast to the strenous hike the day before, this section felt a lot more relaxed and our legs could recover. The beauty of the landscape already exceeded our expectations and it was only day two.

At times the path got very rocky which slowed us down quite a bit. But it all just added to the beauty of this stretch of the path. It felt like we were children playing at the beach, jumping from rock to rock and exploring the caves along the way.

There was not a lot of wildlife to see that day apart from sheep when we were arriving at **Lochranza Bay**. A sweet small village with a small port, castle ruins, and an excellent **whiskey distillery**.

We set up camp for the next two nights at the **Lochranza Campsite**. The next two official sections on the Arran Coastal Way required a lot of road walking which I wanted to avoid as much as possible. So I planned two alternative day hikes from Lochranza into the mountains and back to the campsite. This not only allowed us to skip the road-walking but we were now also able to experience the beautiful Arran mountains.

### <a name="section3"></a>Day 3: Loch na Davie Glen loop (17km)

The nice thing about staying at Lochranza campsite for two nights is that we were able to pack a light backpack with only the essentials. There is no point in carrying your tent, stove and other equipment through the mountains when you walk in a loop. So we headed out slackpack-style with enough water and food for the day but nothing else. Seeing how light the packs had become all of a sudden, gave us a good impression of how much we would usually carry on our backs.

<span class="image-caption">First views into the Glen shortly after the start in Lochranza</span>

Just south of the whiksey distillery in Lochranza we found an entrance into the Loch na Davie Glen. It's a short ascent into the Glen on a smooth trail. While the weather looked like rain in the morning, it cleared up once we went into the Glen but we could still see the rain clouds looming over the mountains in the distance. We reached **Loch na Davie** after a couple of easy water crossings. It was a slot smaller than we had expected and we almost missed it. It did definitely make for a great location for a snack break.

<span class="image-caption">No path but typical Scottish mountain vegetation</span>

From Loch na Davie we headed deeper into the Glen where we lost the path, or where there was no clear path to continue on. It did not matter to us. We were in an epxploration mode with all the great views and the beautiful typical Scottish mountain vegetation. Which, unless wet, is very pleasant to walk on. Speaking of wet, the rain of the previous days created some very boggy patches on our way to the valley.

![Impressive views all the way to the coast of Catacol](./images/03-through-the-valley-to-catacol.jpg)
<span class="image-caption">Impressive views all the way to the coast of Catacol</span>

The view did get even more spectacular when we turned into the next valley that would bring us to **Catacol**. The mild downwards slope allowed us to see all the way to the shore. At the same time, all clouds disappeared and the strong midday sun came out, making the landscape even more enjoyable. Luckily we came prepared with hats and sunscreen.

The descend into Catacol was very pleasant and we were hiking along a smaller river for most of the time. A couple of bigger slabs in the water formed a waterfall and the lush and soft meadow righ next to it was the perfect place to rest. A great opportunity to refill water and to soak in the sun.

![Plants at the shore in Catacol](./images/03-catacol-plants.jpg)
<span class="image-caption">Plants at the shore in Catacol.</span>

After a short break in Catacol, we could decide to either take the bus back to Lochranza or to opt for the old postman's path that also goes from Catacol back to Lochranza through the forest. The lighter packs definitely made this an easy choice. We still had plenty of energy and time. Plus, the weather was just perfect for an extra couple of hours hiking.

<span class="image-caption">View back onto Catacol from the postman's path</span>

For the first two kilometers we kind of regretted to have opted for the more strenous option because the ascent into the forst was definitely not a small one and we had already hiked for 12 km through the mountains. Once we made it all the way, that feeling of regret turned into feeling of accomplishment. Also, the forest protected us well from the intense sun.

It was nice to walk into Lochranza from the other side of the bay and from an elevated view point. The castle ruins and the boats in the bay looked all so lovely and we could not wait to get back to the campsire to prepare a big dinner.

## Research

Since I knew that we did not want to follow the Arran Coastal Way all the time because some of the sections were mainly road-walking, I had to do some further research to find hikes on the island. If you're not interested in the research. I used all these sources for planning the hike around Arran:

[walkhighlands.co.uk]: Still the best resource for all long-distance hikes in Scotland. You can find detailed text descriptions, images and GPX files for all sections of the hike along with recommendations on where to stock up on groceries and where to find accommodation. In addition to that they also have a great community forum with plenty of people eager to help you plan your hike.

[Walking on Arran] by Paddy Dillon: After reading about the road walking sections on the hike I bought this book that helped in finding alternative sections all over the island. Paddy provides in-depth descriptions of hikes with detailed custom maps that make it easy to navigate. Still, it would have been great to get the GPX files for the hikes from the website.

[komoot]: A great tool to plan hike paths in detail and to get inspired by hikes that other users submitted. I used it to plan every section on this hike and to re-route on the go when we decided for taking a detour or a shorter path. With the newest version it also lets you plan paths that don't follow official hiking paths which comes in handy when you want to go for an off-road expedition on the numerous hills.

[maps.me]: I exported the hikes to KML and used maps.me for the navigation as it provides free offline maps for pretty much everywhere in the world.

[Google Maps]: Since we did not have campsites to our availability at all sections, I used Google Maps to find possible wild camping spots and it worked out great!
