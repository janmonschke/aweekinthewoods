The West Highland Way (WHW) was my first ever long-distance hike. Before that I only went on day hikes or camping by bike or car but I never hiked with a big backpack carrying a tent, food and water. And I, as it turned out quickly, I did not prepare well enough and made pretty much all the rocky mistakes there are.

In May 2014 I spoke at a conference in Edinburgh, Scotland. While preparing for the talk I got in touch with the organiser's to ask about nice day hikes in the Edinburgh region. I was told there were some nice ones but they were not comparable with the ones in the Highlands and I should rather looking into going on a longer hike there for example the famous West Highland Way. A quick image search resulted in pictures of the stunning landscapes of the Highlands and I was immediately convinced that this was the hike I wanted to go on. Gladly I was not the only one who was super into that idea and a friend happily offered to hike it with me.

The West Highland Way is a long-distance hike that leads you over 154km (96mi) through the west highlands in Scotland. It's a quite famous hike as it offers a variety of landscapes and is very beginner friendly due it's many places to stock up your food supplies and the many hotels along the way. We, however, decided to pack tent and stove and go all in on this hike.

## Research

As for all famous Scottish hikes, the best source of information for the West Highland Way is [walkhighlands.co.uk][]. There you will find detailed section descriptions with images and exhaustive lists of accommodations along the trail. As it turns out, this hike is probably one of the best equipped hikes in Scotland and for every sections there are plenty of options to refill your water, to re-stock with food and to stay over night (hotels and campsites). Each hike on that website has a little forum where people share their experiences and tips and tricks which I found really helpful (even though I should have read them more carefully ;) ).

In addition to the website I bought a book with maps which seemed to be the go-to book for the trail. I saw so many other hikers with the same book while hiking and I can recommend it a lot. It's this one: West Highland Way by Charlie Loram. The maps are hand-drawn which at first seems silly but they turned out to be very exact and the measurements (time and distance) always prove to be correct. On top of that it has great descriptions of the landmarks, the towns, the trails's history and all accommodations.

The original plan was to finish the hike in 7 days but we decided on the first day that it would be a great idea to actually do it in only 6 days. We made that decision before it started to rain that afternoon and not knowing that we would have to hike way longer than planned because it was forbidden to camp at the beginning of the WHW back then. Since there are plenty of villages along the trail you can also make more stops than we did. In fact, if you want to fully indulge on the beautiful landscapes, you should make more stops.

### <a name='section1'></a>Day 1: Milngavie to Milarrochry Bay (37km)

The start of the West Highland Way is located just north of Glasgow in Milngavie which is easily accessible by train or by car. You will definitely bump into other WHW hikers there eagerly stocking up on supplies and taking pictures at the starting point. The trail starts off smoothly through a lightly vegetated forest, then leads you over farmland, passing by a whiskey distillery always having the peaks of the highlands ahead of you. We were lucky with the weather in the beginning with only very light rain and almost no wind but the sun peeking through the clouds every now and then.

Overcast but mostly dry weather on our way to Drymen

It did not take us long before we arrived in Drymen where we wanted to camp in one of the dedicated "wild campsites" (farmers offering their backyard and facilities to hikers for some pounds). Since it was still early afternoon and the weather was nice we decided to continue up until Balmaha. After Drymen the path leads you through a forest before arriving at the foot of Conic Hill. Right when we could see Conic Hill through the forest we also saw heavy rain clouds coming towards us which started to rain right when we were ascending the hill. At that point we were halfway to Balmaha and decided it would not make sense to go back to Drymen to stop there.

Rain started pouring on top of Conic Hill but the view onto Lake Lomond made up for it

The peak of Conic Hill presented a great view onto Loch Lomond. Sadly the rain picked up on our way down to Balmaha which left us arriving completely soaked in the evening. It then turned out that there was no campsite in Balmaha and all hotels were booked out. A quick look in our book showed a campsite a couple of miles outside of Balmaha and we started our the last stretch of our hike right when it started to get dark and the rain still pouring heavily on our already soaked backpacks. When we arrived at the campsite it was pretty hard to find a spot that was not completely flooded but a wet floor was no problem for our tent which I bought with the possibility in mind to pitch it on very wet Scottish soil. The campsite had excellent facilities so we were able to cook with a roof over our heads. We were completely exhausted and the simple pasta dinner tasted like the best thing we ever ate!

### <a name='section2'></a>Day 2: Milarrochry Bay to Inversnaid (17km)

The morning of day two we had a giant breakfast which contained of ALL the cereals and milk we had brought all at once. We did not anticipate at all the appetite that you get when hiking for almost 40km. It was also this morning that we started to socialise with other hikers for the first time. There was a group of 4 hikers (2 German, 2 English) that we connected with immediately and we decided to start the day together.

It was beautiful to hike in the woods and shores right next to Loch Lomond and the sun also came out for most of the day. The trail was easier than on day one but we both felt the exhaustion in our legs from the previous day and we made more breaks. Hiking with another group really made it easier to forget the exhaustion though and we happily chatted along with them.

Lunch with a great view on the lake

At noon we stopped for a lunch right at the stone shore with plenty of sun to dry our clothes. The other group decided to take a ferry to shortcut Loch Lomond and we were by ourselves again. Looking at all the clothes that were drying we realised that we packed way too many clothes for the hike. I brought 4 T-Shirts, socks for each day, jeans and two jumpers. I had no prior experience hiking a long trail so I thought it would be like on a regular vacation where you change clothes very often. In the end I only used 2 T-Shirts (fast-drying ones) and three pairs of socks. The jeans I should've just left home since it never really dried during the hike and was just excess weight.

After lunch we met another group of hikers who were had a similar rhythm like us and we continued together along the shores of Loch Lomond. After some hours it started to rain heavily again and we found shelter in the Inversnaid Hotel where, of all people, we met the group of hikers from the morning again. They also got caught in the rain after leaving the ferry. Since it did not stop raining we all camped at the Inversnaid Bunkhouse which has a tiny campsite but great facilities and warm, comfy food. It felt great to warm up with the entire group in the bunk house after all the rain.

### <a name='section3'></a>Day 3: Inversnaid to Tyndrum (30km)

We woke up early from the sun shining super bright onto our tent and the sun kept shining the entire day. This was probably the best day on our hike. Starting out with the German / English crew onto the last section on the hike next to Loch Lomond. There were more and more hills on the trail now and it really felt like we finally arrived in the Highlands. The north of Loch Lomond was even more beautiful than what we had seen of it the prior days but we were also looking forward to finally reach the hills.

After a lunch stop in Inverarnan we said goodbye to the other group who had to take a break in that town due injuries and my friend and me were on our own again. But only for a short period of time because we started talking to a fellow hiker who was going at a pretty fast pace. He agreed to hike together for some time but he wanted us to not feel like we had to walk slower only to join him because he was already 64 years old and probably not as fast as us. He said that while pretty much running next us. His name was Collin and he was a shepherd. It was perfect to hike with him because he taught us so much about the flowers and animals along the path which kept us very entertained.

It always stunned me how far you could see on the trail
Beautiful Highlands
Reaching Tyndrum via the road

We decided to hike together up until Tyndrum and he told us that he would always stop there to get his favourite Cullen Sink, a rich potato soup with smoke Haddock. The second half of this section provided us with nice hikes through the hills with great weather. Just a perfect place and time for a hike. On top of that we also saw the Hogwarts Express which is the actual train from the Harry Potter movies which rides through the Highlands a couple of times per day. We were completely caught off guard when it arrived and it was a pretty magical moment seeing it. Even though we did not want to hike for that long again, he kept motivating us to push through with him. Sadly we arrived just 15 minutes too late for the restaurant that served his soup but found a great pub that had enormous pizzas which was an equally good alternative. We pitched our tents together just outside of Tyndrum, next to, what we only found out the next morning, what seemed to be an abandoned grave yard 👻.

### <a name='section4'></a>Day 4: Tyndrum to Kingshouse (29km)

Colin was already gone when we woke up the next day. We think we were probably too slow for him ;) This section of the hike was again dominated by green hills and a lot of up and down but started with several miles of mostly level hiking on the foot of several hills. An easy start after the long day before. After passing Bridge of Orchy the path got more challenging going up Black Mount and then passing several lochs and moors. Again very typical Scottish landscape that did not grew old on us.

Yes, there was still snow on top of some mountains

We expected bad weather on this section from feedback that we got from other hikers and the book guide but apart from some drops of rain and fog on the hills we were fine. The last bit that day was a long descend into the valley of Kingshouse. Kingshouse is a hotel in the middle of nowhere, literally the middle of nowhere. There is a highway in the valley but no other houses in sight for several kilometres. After what seemed like an eternity we finally arrived at the Kingshouse campsite (free!) and were greeted by a smiling Colin who arrived there an hour before us.

We pitched our tent next to the many other tents right behind Kingshouse surrounded by deer. A very magical place to arrive to after a long hike. While the main hotel is not open for hikers without reservations, Kingshouse has a special pub-like room dedicated to WHW hikers where they serve gigantic dinners and a variety of local whiskeys. We spent the evening eating, drinking and talking with our friend Colin and his daughter (who joined him there to finish the rest of hike together). It always surprises me how easy it is to get caught in deep conversations with people that you just met that day. Must be something about the hiker's nature...

### <a name='section5'></a>Day 5: Kingshouse to Kinlochleven (15km)

Again, Colin had already left when we woke up, even though we set an early timer. We wanted to be up early for this section. Not a long section but definitely a tough one since the first major hurdle on this hike is the devil's staircase. After descending to Kingshouse's valley the day before we now had to go back up the mountain on this steep zig-zag path that just did not want to end. To be fair, we had walked faster than we had anticipated and our untrained bodies were not ready for hiking so long without a pause. So this steep incline took us quite a while to finish. Almost at the top we had a quick snack break and we turned around to take in the great views onto Glencoe. The entire day we hiked with great views until we started the descent onto Kinlochleven which should mark our stop for that day.

A shorter day than usual but a well deserved "rest" day. When we arrived at the MacDonald Campsite we met the English / German hiking group again who made their way to Kinlochleven partly by bus and small hikes. They seemed very beaten up but when they saw us they lit up again.

Preparing a big breakfast in save distance from the midges

For our last day of hiking we wanted to make sure to start with a great breakfast so we cooked up pretty much all we had left from in our bags. The day before we found a great spot at the campsite right next to a lake and we were wondering why no one pitched their tent there. Well, we found out pretty quickly why that morning because we got attacked by clouds of Highland midges. Many people had warned us about these special kinds of mosquitos that only exist in the Scottish Highlands but we were lucky to not have encountered them before. They do bite, but their bites don't sting much and go away quite quickly. The worst thing about them is the fact that they are super tiny and come in clouds that eat surround you within seconds. Luckily we could cook in a little shed, safe from the beasts.

Again, beautiful weather on our last day

That big breakfast gave us the needed energy for the last leg up the mountains, through valleys, alongside moors with stunning views on various munros. The weather was great again, no wind, the sun was shining as if Scotland wanted to show itself from its best side on this last stretch. Hiking into Fort William felt great, even though people give you the looks for showing up in dirty hiking clothes but it didn't matter to us. Finishing was a great feeling and we rested up in the sun in Fort Williams that afternoon. Our train left later that day and it took just 3.5h to get back to Glasgow. 3.5h by train what took us 6 days by foot ;)

Learnings

This being my first long-distance hike, I naturally made many mistakes. The first one being that I packed way too many things. I probably did not thing about it too much before, because why else would I have started the hike in jeans and brought so many extra pairs of clothes. It is totally fine to not wear fresh clothes every day. After one day of hiking your fresh clothes will be dirty again anyways so it does not really make a difference if they're worn when you start the next day. It will only take you a day or two to get used to it but it is totally fine.

The next thing I learned was to get yourself familiar with your gear before you start the hike. In our case we had troubles setting up the tent at night with heavy rain pouring down on us because we had never really set it up before. Try to set up your tent just once before you start and you're good ;) Same goes for your backpack. You should find a comfortable setting before you start, otherwise you will spend days fiddling around with it which can be very tiring. Best seek for help in an outdoor shop, the staff there usually is pretty helpful.

Boots! Yes, boots! Bring boots that are worn in and that you feel comfortable in. This was probably my biggest problem on the hike. I had bought boots just before the hike, the same ones that I usually bought, but I did not wear them in before which resulted in very bad blisters from day one on. Whenever I buy a pair of boots now I make sure to wear them for a couple of days during the week or I go on day hikes. You really don't want to increase the risk for blisters on such a long hike. It is probably not possible to 100% prevent them, but at least you're minimizing the risk by bringing good shoes.
