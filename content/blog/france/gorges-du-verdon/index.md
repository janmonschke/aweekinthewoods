![Hiking into the Gorges du Verdon](./cover.jpg)

The Verdon river is one of the most beautiful places to stay and hike in the soutch of France. On this trip we are starting on the ancienne route Napoléon in Saint-Vallier-de-Thiey from where we are slowly making our way to the Verdon gorge over mountains and through forests. This trip had it all: nights with freezing temperatures and days with 30°C and no shade; long stretches of flat and easy dirt roads and near vertical ascends on exposed rock formations. All you could ever ask from week in the woods!
