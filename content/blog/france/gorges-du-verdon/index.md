![Hiking into the Gorges du Verdon](./cover.jpg)

The Verdon river is one of the most beautiful places to stay and hike in the south of France. On this trip we are starting on the "ancienne route Napoléon" in Saint-Vallier-de-Thiey from where we are slowly making our way to the Verdon gorge over mountains, through forests and tunnels. This trip had it all: nights with freezing temperatures and days with 30°C and no shade; long stretches of flat and easy dirt roads and near vertical ascends on exposed rock formations.

### <a name='section1'></a>Day 1: Saint-Vallier-de-Thiey to Escragnolles (??km)

After a rainy but relaxed evening in **Grasse** (which is very easy to reach via **Nice**), we took the earliest **[LER 31](https://services-zou.maregionsud.fr/fr/horaires/Zou-LER/Bus/ligne/LER-31/direction/OUTWARD/919)** bus towards **Saint-Vallier-de-Thiey** which marked the beginning of the hike. While the bus slowly made its way up the mountain, we enjoyed the stunning all the way to the ocean.

From the city center we followed a small pedestrian path into a dense and still slightly humid birch forest. The ground was still soft from the rain of the previous night which made it easier for us to walk with our very heavy backpacks. They were extra heavy on this trip because we knew we did not have many options to resupply along the trail so we carried almost all food for all six days from the beginning.

After the forest opened up, we reached our first valley views and the next couple of kilometers we went up and down small hills alongside the valley. In the forest we noticed that a dog was following us. It did have a harness but no tag and it looked pretty weak. We gave it some water and from that moment on it became very attached to us. We tried several times to tell it to go back to its owner but it did not listen and it stubbornly followed us.

We could see that the weather was getting worse and we luckily walked through forest again when it started to rain so it did not hit us as much.

When the rain stopped, we started our biggest ascend for that day on the **ancienne route Napoléon**, an old trading route with great views of the valley. We followed it all the way up to **La Colette** right before **Escragnolles** where we took a small break and managed to communicate to some locals that they call the animal shelter to take care of the dog.

We did not mind the dog but when we arrived at the road, it started to chase cars and almost got itself killed, so we thought it would be best to get it into the hands of professionals.

From La Colette we walked down to and through Escragnolles on the lookout for a hidden campsite. Just outside of Escragnolles, half way to the **Cascade du ray** waterfall we found a small forest that fit our tents perfectly. It was far away from the village and nobody could spot us from any of the surrounding streets.

### <a name='section2'></a>Day 2: Escragnolles to La Roque Esclapon (??km)

![Catching the morning sun](./images/02-catching-the-morning-sun.jpg)
<span class="image-caption">Catching the morning sun</span>

The sun was shining on us all morning and we were able to dry all our clothes and the tents. Without the clouds we now also had a great view of the valley that we slept in. After a big, long breakfast we started to hike towards the rushing waterfall that we heard in the distance all morning.

<span class="image-caption">Refilling the water bottlels with fresh water from the waterfall</span>

After just a couple hundred meters we arrived at **cascade du ray**. I don't actually know how high it was because it was hard to find onformation on it in the first place. It was just a mere accident that I saw it on the maps and routed the hike this way on a hunch that this would provide a great view early in the morning which it definitely did.

With our water bottles full of fresh water, we then started the ascent onto the plains close to the source of the waterfall. There was again very few info on how complicated this section would be and I think I would have not routed us this way if I had known that we had to go on a proper vertical ascent with our full backpacks. But in the end I'm happy we did. Even though it was sketchy at times, the feeling of achievement and the great views were totally worth it.

The plains proved to be rather boring but also quite easy so we made good progress quickly. We still had to meet up with a friend who wanted to join us in the second half of the day and it looked like we could actually make it to the meeting point in time. These meetings in the middle of hikes are kind of a tradition for us by now and we have become quite good at it. We agreed to meet around a certain GPS position at specific time but communicating prove quite complicated so we had to hope for the best. When we started to hike up the hill with the meeting point it started to rain heavily and had to take cover in the bushes. It was then when we heard our friend walking down the main path, singing his hiking jingles, enjoying his little walk under the rain by himself. We made it again, we managed to meet in the middle of nowhere with no way to communicate.

The rain continued for the descend down that hill and only stopped when we arrived in the village of **La Roque Esclapon**. We got quite cold and in the end decided to rent a three room tent with a small kitchen and a small heater. This simple tent felt almost lavish for us and it did well to our mood. We had a hearty dinner, played some games and just enjoyed each other's company.

### <a name='section3'></a>Roundtrip to Château Sabran de Pontèves from Camping Notre Dame (??km)

![The weather looks a lot more promising in La Bastide](./images/03-the-weather-looks-a-lot-more-promising.jpg)
<span class="image-caption">The weather looks a lot more promising in La Bastide</span>

Since the previous day was so exhausting with a couple of hills to climb in the cold rain, we decided to take it easy this day. With only snacks in our backpacks we went on a round-trip hike to a former castle (**Château Sabran de Pontèves**) in **Bargème**. The first stop however was the village of **La Bastide** where we found a cute boulangerie with amazing pastries.

![Enjoying pastries in a boulangerie in La Bastide](./images/03-enjoying-the-pastries-from-the-local-boulangerie.jpg)
<span class="image-caption">Enjoying pastries in a boulangerie in La Bastide</span>

From there we hiked up the mountains over several farmer's pastures onto the path to the old castle. It was easy walking from there on and we took long brakes on the side of the path. We could see the castle in the distance the entire time and we were looking forward to stop there for a relaxed lunch.

<span class="image-caption">We seem to attract dogs everywhere we go</span>

The village of Bargème was even smaller than we expected. It's just a couple houses, an old church, the old castle and a cute restaurant. If we had not had our own lunch with us, we would have definitely checked out the restaurant. The views we had from the castle back into the valley were stunning and we took our time relaxing there for quite some time.

On the way back we could see rain clouds in the far distance coming our way so we hurried up a bit but made it back just in time for the rain to start. In the well protected tent we had another lovely dinner and our final hot shower at that nice campsite. The owners were super lovely, answering all out questions and just generally nice to talk to. They even offered to drive us to the next campsite on our trip because we would have to walk on the street for a long time which we dreaded a lot. And who are we to not take them up on that offer?
